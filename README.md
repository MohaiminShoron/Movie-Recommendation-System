# Movie-Recommendation-System
Here I built a simple Moive recommender system in python . I used a dataset containing more than 48K samples and 25 features. But I used mainly 4 features here to find similar movies from the Movie user liked using Cosine Similarity and displayed top 20 most similar films.
